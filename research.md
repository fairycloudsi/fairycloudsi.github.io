# Research Projects and Publications 

## Projects 
- [Randomized Fast Subspace Descent Scheme](https://github.com/fairycloudsi/LS_eg_data/blob/master/README.md) 
1. Developed a general scheme of gradient methods. 
2. Analyzed convergence for both convex and strongly convex problems. 
3. Numerical experiments on Nestrov's worst function and Ridge Penalized Logistic Regression. 

- Non-uniform Sampling Fast Least Squares Solver
1. Developed fast solver for large scale ill-conditioned least squares problem. 
2. Constructed preconditioner via importance sampling and Gauss Aeidel Algorithms. 
3. Improved Performance up to 70% compared to diagonal precoditioned CG. 
4. Handled largest matrix size around 27 million.
