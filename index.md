# Welcome to Huiwen's Pages

I am a graduating Ph.D majored in Applied Math from University of California, Irvine. 
I am actively looking for position as machine learning engineer and data scientist. 

My thesis topic is randomized solvers for linear and nonlinear problems in data science. I tried to apply and improve optimization methods in machine learning problems. 

Here is a glance of my [research projects.](research.md) 

I also have a strong interest in applying optimization methods to real world data challenges. 

Here is a lists of projects for solving real world problems by utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques. [Check Here.](projects.md)

## Research Interests:
Numerical Linear Algebra| Random Matrix Theory| Numerical Optimization ([CV](HuiwenWu_CV_0809.pdf))
