## Welcome to Huiwen's Pages 

I am a graduating Ph.D majored in Applied Math from University of California, Irvine. 
I am actively looking for position as machine learning engineering and data scientist. 

My thesis topic is randomized solvers for linear and nonlinear problems in data science. I tried to apply and improve 
optimization methods to machine learning problems. 

Here is a glance of my research projects. 

- Randomized Fast Subspace Descent Scheme 
1. Developed a general scheme of gradient methods. 
2. Analyzed convergence for both convex and strongly convex problems. 
3. Numerical experiments on Nestrov's worst function and Ridge Penalized Logistic Regression. 

- Non-uniform Sampling Fast Least Squares Solver
1. Developed fast solver for large scale ill-conditioned least squares problem. 
2. Constructed preconditioner via importance sampling and Gauss Aeidel Algorithms. 
3. Improved Performance up to 70% compared to diagonal precoditioned CG. 
4. Handled largest matrix size around 27 million. 

I also have a strong interest in applying optimization methods to real world data challenges. 

Here is a lists of projects for solving real world problems by utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques.

- Home Credit Default Risk
1. Developed k-fold LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) model. 
2. Predicted repayment capabilities of each client. 
3. Achieved AUC (area under the curve) to 0.787 compared with Logistic Regression model 0.671 and Random Forest model 0.678. 
4. Training data has 307,511 observations and 122 features and testing data has 48,744 observations and 121 features. 

- NLP Sentiment Analysis with Emoji Labels 
1. Converted training/testing features into vector list using pre-trained GloVe model. 
2. Inserted a keras Embedding layer given word to vector mapping. 
3. Build and trained a 2 layer LSTM network. 
4. Achieved sentiment classification for sentences and labeled with emoji. 

- Game Recommedation System 
1. Scrapped user data (17.3MB) and app data (510.2MB) from Steam. 
2. Sotred app data in MySQL database. 
3. Trained content-based model and item-based model. 
4. Created a website providing 5 recommendations for each user in list.
